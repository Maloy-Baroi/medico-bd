Mass testing is essential in that case. This is the only way to get a full picture of the extent of the danger. The Clungene® COVID-19 rapid test is practical and affordable, and your company doctor can perform in-house testing on your co-workers.\n\nThe key to prevention\n\nThe antigen rapid test is a perfect complement to the IgG/IgM rapid test also available in our web shop. If the IgG/IgM test is positive, it is worth to check and confirm the result with an antigen test. The Antigen Rapid Test Cassette also helps monitor contact persons and provides reliable information if someone at your company shows symptoms specific to COVID-19.\n\nBy using IgG/IgM and antigen test combined, you can always have a clear picture of the current state of your employees’ health. This is essential if you want to avoid the shutdown and or mass sick pays. With your company having an own test kit, you will not be exposed to the test capacity of the state healthcare, not to mention waitlists and possible test shortages.\n\nHow the antigen rapid test works\n\nLike every virus, SARS-CoV-2 has a unique protein too. Our immune system recognizes the virus based on this protein and starts the defend by producing antibodies. Similar to the PCR test, the antigen test also identifies the presence of the protein. It means, that this test is able to directly detect the presence of the virus in the human body. It is important to know that the detection of the antigens is only possible for 7 days after the symptoms have appeared. Testing should be done at this time.\n\nBenefits:\n\nYou have to wait only 15-30 minutes for the result\nNo blood taking is required for the test, as it works with samples from the mucous membranes of the nose or the mouth.\nSignificantly more cost-effective than a PCR test.\nYou can get reliable results in the early phase of the infection.\nCLUNGENE Covid-19 Antigen Rapid Test\nThe CLUNGENE Covid-19 antigen rapid test is a lateral flow immunoassay for the qualitative detection of an acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. The rapid test is delivered with the necessary accessories and can be carried out at the point of care. The results can be read 15 minutes after specimen application. No cross-reactivity with influenza viruses and human coronaviruses (229E, OC43, NL63, HKU1) has been detected.\n\nThe test is designed to detect SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antigens in nasal, nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens\n\nNasopharyngeal specimens are collected by inserting a swab into the nose to collect the specimen from the posterior wall of the nasopharynx. Oropharyngeal specimens are collected by inserting a swab into the posterior pharynx and tonsillar areas and rubbing over both tonsillar pillars and the posterior oropharynx.\n\nThe nasal swab is taken from the nasal mucosa - to do this, the swab is inserted approx. 2.5 cm into the nostril and passed along the nasal mucosa several times. The procedure is repeated with the same swab in the other nostril.\n\nThe antigen test is suitable for the detection of the following variants: Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), Gamma (P.1), Delta (B.1.617.2), Lambda (C.37) and Omicron (B.1.1.529)\n\nProduct Details\nCLUNGENE Covid-19 antigen rapid test\nLateral flow immunoassay\nQualitative antigen test\nCE Certified\nSpecificity: 99,7%\nSensitivity: 98,0% (≤33)\nSample material: nasal, nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs\nNo cross-reactivity with influenza viruses, rhinoviruses or human coronaviruses (229E, OC43, NL63, HKU1)\nTest results can be read after 15 minutes\nStorage between 4 and 30°C\nTest performance at room temperature (15-30°C, test material should be brought to room temperature first)\nEach test is sealed in a foil pouch\nClungene Rapid Self Testing Kit for home use.
